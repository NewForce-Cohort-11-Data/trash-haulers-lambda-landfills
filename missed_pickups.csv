The first incident was closed indicating that my bin was not on the curb (per the worker), which is ridiculous.  I work from home now, so I heard the truck go up the street - when I looked, the trash bin was lifted but the bin was not emptied.  I have pictures of the bin and how it was placed back on my land, as well as my neighbors - one who's bin is on the grass (like mine) and one who's bin was emptied from the driveway.  My bin has been almost demolished by this worker as well -  when it rains, my bin floods.  I understand normal wear and tear, but these episodes are making me question why this is occurring with no action by Public Works.  

I am soliciting your assistance in not only having consistent trash pick up (my bin is awaiting pickup due to two escalated ticket requests - 188904 and 188849.

Thank you!  I have pictures that I'd like to provide as well.

Asked to speak with a supervisor-I needed my trash picked up.  Said they would have the supervisor call and it is now 10:00 am and no one has called.  This happen at least twice a month.

My trash is still here ( I'm disabled and it is difficult to take containers down my driveway.  When I went down today to pull it back up, I found my trash was not collected).  I called my next door neighbor and they stated their two containers were not emptied yesterday either.  I usually hear and see the trash truck go down our street and then come back up.  My neighbor indicated the same and neither of us saw or heard the truck yesterday.
The recycling truck DID come.thru and collect yesterday.
We have trash that carries odors and it is not good to have it sitting for another week.
If the truck will be coming around to collect, please have someone.call me so I'm able to get the container back down the driveway.

In fact, it was picked up today at 4:09 PM.  One FULL DAY LATE.  This is totally unacceptable.  Animals could easily get into the curby and make an awful mess.  
This is my second complaint this summer about this service.  This summer is the first time since the curby program was instituted that we've had any problems.  Now it seems like problems are the new normal.  
SOMETHING needs to be done.  This must be corrected.

He emptied my next door neighbors can, He emptied the can across the street from where my cans were and he went up and down the streets emptying everyone's cans but mine.  This is not the first time this has happened.  I even watched him drive by my cans once when I was outside watching.  I stopped him on the way out of the neighborhood and asked the driver way he didn't empty mine.  His answer was ""Oh, I guess I didn't see them"".  Isn't that his job?  To look for cans at the curb so he can empty them.  My cans were at the curb, the view of them was not obstructed by vehicles, bushes or anything else.  The road was not obstructed by any parked vehicles to prevent him from getting to them.  My cans are full and I want them picked up by Tuesday morning.

We recently purchased this property and the seller/former owner of the home unfortunately used recycling containers as their trash cans. We put signs on the cans Thursday evening prior to Friday's trash pick up trying to help identify that the items in the bins were trash and not recycling. Also, since we are moving, unpacking, etc. we have some items next the cans that need to be picked up as trash. Once we have a clean slate and everything is picked up, we will be able to dispose of trash and recycling as desired. Currently, we don't have any room to put anything other than on the ground next to the cans. 

Thank you,
